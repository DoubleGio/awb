            <h2>Browser Compatability Report</h2>
            <p>We tested on Chrome and Safari.</p>
            <p>We only found one "major" difference in the compatability of these browsers, the <em>&lt;widows&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;orphans&gt;</em> didn't work for Safari, but besides that they both behaved properly.</p>

                The main difference with the version made in Words is that it has a premade head, filled with Word settings. It also has a lot more tags in the html, like this: <pre>&lt;html xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"

                "b" is a style markup, just for making something look bold, while "strong" denotes text with a strong emphasis. It doesn't just makes text bold. For example: if a text to speech program needs to shout bold text, it needs "strong" to recognize the text it needs to shout.

                    W3C Internationalization Activity has as mission to ensure that W3C's formats and protocols are usable worldwide. These protocols and formats should be usable in all languages and in all writing systems.
                    To ensure this the Internationalization Activity the work is divided in groups: Internationalization Working Group, Internationalization Interest Group and Internationalization Tag Set Interest Group.<br>
                    The Internationalization Working Group provide a wide range of advice and support for groups developing or using international aspects of the Web. Looking for issues that would cause barriers to deployment and use of Web technologies due to language, script, region or culture.<br>
                    Whereas the Internationalization Interest Group provide documents with requirements, guidelines and proposals for specification writers, as well as educational resources, checkers and outreach to help developers and content authors better understand each other.<br>
                    The last group provides a set of concepts that can be mapped to markup and that makes it easier to internationalize and localize documents.</li>

                    IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) also known as IPng (Internet Protocol next generation) is the newest version of the Internet Protocol. The main features of this protocol are providing identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the internet. The IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the IP used for identifying hosts on a network using an addressing system. The IPv4 makes use of a 32-bit address scheme. The total number of IP-addresses will be 2^32. The internet is growing so fast that eventually there will not be enough IP-addresses. One of the main reasons to move from IPv4 to IPv6 is that the newer version makes it possible to generate more IP-addresses using a 128-bit address scheme. Another reasons to move from IPv4 to IPv6 includes better end-to-end connectivity, faster routing and better security.</li>

                        Given this table I think the tokenizer did its job quite well. The terms were counted good. An improvement would be filtering stop words.</li>
                    <li>
                        It makes sense to include all of the “top 30 words” in the stop words list. Because stop words refer to the most common used words. The “top 30 words” classify as stop words.</li>
                    <li>
                        Looking at the top 30 list I don’t think the frequency follows the Zipf’s law. The number 1 on the list is twice as much as the number 2 on the list (number 1: 1644 and number two: 872). But the law doesn’t hold if you compare the rest of the list with each other. Let’s take number 2 on the list with number 3 on the list for example. You see that the top 30 doesn’t follow the Zipf’s law. Because the frequency of number 2 is not twice as much as the frequency of number three (number 2: 872 and number 3: 729).</li>

                        In this case Heaps Law describes the dictionary size as a function of the input token. As the input tokens increases the dictionary size increases as well.</li>

                        We think that the quality of the TF-based search is good. The recall and  precision are not that high because many result are not relevant.</li>
                    <li>
                        Compared to the TF-based search the results of TFIDF-based search are lower. Also the results are decimal numbers instead of whole numbers. These terms have the highest TFIDF scores:

                                “queen” - 3.14 (CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground)</li>
                            <li>
                                “tea” - 3.44 (CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party)</li>
                            <li>
                                “bill” - 3.66 (CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill)</li>
                        </ul>
                        We think these terms describe the associated Alice chapter well because these term can be found in the name of the chapter.</li>

                        We weren’t able to find the answer to this question. We asked all the available TA’s 20 januari from 13:30 till 16:30. No one knew the answer.</li>
                    <li>
                        If you implement the improvements suggested to the tokenizer in question 1a then precision and recall will both be higher. Because there would be more relevant results.</li>

                            In this context idempotent means keeping track of status information</li>

                            Idempotent requests simplify the implementation of a caching HTTP proxy because information is being stored.</li>
                        <li>
                            Because visitor counters aren’t idempotent (e.g.: “visitors”++;).</li>

                            A single visitor can use different proxies, causing him to be counted multiple times.</li>

                    HTTP is a so-called stateless protocol because HTTP treats each request as an independent transaction. This has nothing to do with any requests made in the past.</li>

                        <dt>Cons:</dt>
                        <dd>Every requests needs more information compared to a stateful protocol.</dd>
                        <dd>It is hard to build online shops with a "shopping basket" functionality without the use of cookies because the cookies are a mechanism for websites to remember stateful information. The cookies keep track of which user is assigned to which shopping basket. The server sends a cookie to the client. The client has a unique identifier. Because cookies are sent to the server with every request the client makes, that session identifier will be sent back to the server every time the user visits a new page on the website. This lets to server now what items are in the shopping bag.</dd>

                    A 303 status code in response to a HTTP/1.1 request stands for that the server does not have a representation of the target resource that can be transferred by the server over HTTP. <br>

                    Because when you send a HEAD request, you get no actual content (no body), so there’s no content of which to know the type of. We expect a JSON file because that was indicated on their website.<br>

                    Security breaches, identity theft, privacy violations, and the social              disruptions of globalization.
                    We feel like these topics are better left to existing research fields, because web scientists are the people who just provide the tools they made, dealing with how people use their tools has nothing to do with the creator. </li>

                    In the context of web commerce the term the long tail refers to as a rank-size distribution. Making it possible to sell a large number of unique items without have large quantities. The long tail can still be profitable for online shops because they can use this strategy to sell unique items without having large quantities.</li>

                    The role of data.gov in the discussion about a more transparent government is that they provide an increased public access to federal government datasets. A potential danger of sites like data.gov is that some information might fall in the wrong hands. People can use the information they find for the wrong purpose. </li>

                    We don’t think Jakob Nielsen top 10 list is still relevant. Almost every point is outdated. Problems in his top 10 that have become rare in 2016 are for example: Bad Search, Not Changing the Color of Visited Links and Fixed Font Size. From our own experience we don’t know of any severe usability problems we encounter on current Web sites that are missing on this list. </li>

                    “reddit.com”; The A-version would be the original design, the B-version would be a version with a different kind of index (at the top). By distributing the different versions to live traffic you get a good measure of the performances.
                 The dependent variable is the performance and the independent variables are the versions.
                Our hypotheses would be that the difference between the versions would be so small that it barely would make any difference. </li>

                    Because the format is standardized, the files can be readily analyzed by a variety of web analysis programs. Such a program can check the link structure by analyzing the web logs and check the performance (load times and such).
                    The dependent variable is the web log and the independent variable is the link structure.
                    Our hypotheses would be that the experiment would end with with us finding an 
                    improvement to our link structure. </li>

                    The first version of Google available is from 1998, where Google is still in beta / a prototype. It was a barebones website with a header and two links sending you to two versions of Google, which only had ~25 million pages to search through. You also see that it’s something made by Stanford University. It did already have the google logo back then.
                    In 2000 Google was out of beta and they had become an independent company. Their index consisted of over 1 billion web pages by now. You could also pick out of several different languages and they were accepting job applications. Later that year they also added filtering options for searching. They also added options for adding Google search to your site.
                    In the second half of 2001 Google added image search and their index was up to 1,5 billion webpages.
                    A year later they added a ‘news’ tab, which is pretty similar to Google’s current news tab.
                    In 2004 they’ve added a couple of new services, one of which being “Froogle”, which was used for web-shopping.
                    In 2006 Google bought Youtube.
                    In 2007 Gmail and video search existed.
                    In 2008 Google Maps was released.
                    In 2010 the Google logo got an updated look and we also began to see the Google “Doodles”.
                    In 2012 they introduced Google+. In 2015 they redesigned again to get to the Google we currently have. </li>
